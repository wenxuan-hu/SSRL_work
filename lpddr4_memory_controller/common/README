These are library files created by John Archambeault in the beginning of 2007.

They are (from lowest level to highest).

rrarb.v - round robin arbiter

syncfifo_mem1r1w.v - RTL encoding of a 1 read 1 write RAM.  Can be
                     replaced with RAM equivalent (FPGA or ASIC).

syncfifo_reg.v - Generic synchronous (rd clk = wr clk) FIFO. FF Based.
syncfifo_ram.v - Generic synchronous (rd clk = wr clk) FIFO. RAM Based
syncfifo.v - Synchronous FIFO that supports a small syncfifo_reg.sv for Head and a deeper syncfifo_ram.sv

levelsync.v - Simple double FF for single signals crossing clock domains.
              Has a reset value.

levelsync_sr.v - Same as levelsync, but with reset and set.

asyncfifo.v - Async FIFO. RAM Based
